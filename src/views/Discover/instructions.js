        <strong>Each person that engages in the JourneyLIFE process will articulate their life purpose within one of ten general Identities.</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        This Identity is how we view our true self. Whether it is a Leader of a particular group or a Quant that analyzes data, we find our core sense of peace knowing who we are internally.
        <br />
        <br />
        This exercise will help you to select the Identity that makes you feel most “at home” and help you to narrow a set of Impact Verbs that can be used within your purpose statement!
